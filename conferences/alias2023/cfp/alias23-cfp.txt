The 3rd IEEE Intl. Workshop on ALgorithms for Indoor Architectures and Systems
              (ALIAS 2023), collocated with the

     24th IEEE Intl. Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM 2023)

                   July 3, 2023, Singapore

AIMS & TOPICS OF INTEREST:

The IEEE Intl. Workshop on ALgorithms for Indoor Architectures and Systems (ALIAS)
aims to share new research paradigms in constituent technologies and enabling
infrastructure of Indoor Information Systems (IIS), ranging from data-driven
localization algorithms leveraging artificial neural networks, to data privacy
handling schemes, and indoor data management operators. Driven by the fact that
90% of human activities are carried out in indoor spaces, the successful launching
of popular IIS applications relies on stored indoor spatial models fusing sensor
information, exploiting sensor prevalence in smartphone devices and wireless
connectivity pervasiveness, in light of the big data era and accompanying technologies.
As such, ALIAS serves as a forum to present latest research and engineering results
while setting the scene for future innovations in Algorithms for Indoor Architectures
and Systems.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Technologies for indoor positioning (e.g., Cellular 3G/4G/5G, Wi-Fi, UWB, RFID, Magnetic,
Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning, Vision, Hybrid, etc.)
* Contact tracing and social distancing for pandemics
* 2D and 3D operators for localization and analytics
* Modeling and representation of indoor spaces
* Indoor GIS integration efforts (IndoorOSM, IndoorGML)
* Storage, processing and indexing operators for indoor data
* Collaborative positioning and crowdsourcing
* Indoor analytics and indoor decision support systems
* Hazard dispersion in indoor spaces
* Agent-based modelling
* Visual analytics of indoor data
* Big-data processing of indoor data
* Privacy issues with indoor technologies
* Human mobility data acquisition, handling, and analysis in indoor spaces
* Data quality and uncertainty issues study on indoor mobility data
* Discovery of indoor mobility patterns
* Theoretic and/or empirical indoor modelling issues
* Semantic knowledge harvesting and ontologies for indoor data
* Recommender Systems for indoor data (e.g., POIs, services)
* Real-time analysis of data generated in indoor spaces (audio, video, text)
* Social behaviour analysis on indoor mobility data
* Machine learning on indoor data
* Security and Privacy in indoor mobile systems
* Robotics for logistics operations in indoor spaces
* Indoor Case Studies (e.g., Healthcare, Airports, Campuses)
* Interactive media technologies to indoor (Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality)
* Offline and Hybrid Online/Offline Navigation and Context Awareness
* Mapmatching Algorithms and Systems
* Out-of-the-box application domains for indoor (blockchain, AI, IoT)

The workshop will be organized in a manner that fosters interaction and
exchange of ideas among the participants. Besides regular papers, we
will also consider vision papers that have the potential to stimulate
debate on existing solutions or open  challenges. We additionally plan
to accept a limited number of demonstration papers where researchers and
technologists will have the opportunity to describe an innovative system
or tool in the area of data management for mobile and wireless access.
We discourage the submission of incremental papers.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper/Vision/Demo Submission: Fri., March 31, 2023 (midnight AoE)
Notification of Acceptance:   Fri., April 14, 2023 
Camera-ready Version Due:     Fri., Apr. 28, 2023 (midnight AoE)
Workshop Date:                Mon., July 3, 2023


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Manuscripts  in  the following  categories  will  be considered  for
publication in the 2nd IEEE Intl. Workshop on ALgorithms for Indoor
Architectures and Systems:

* Regular papers  (max. 6  pages): The  submission should  describe
significant  theoretical and/or  experimental  contributions to  the
topics of the workshop.

* Vision or Demo  papers (max. 3 pages): The  submission should either describe
some vision in the scope of the workshop or the architecture, implementation
and usage of innovative tools or systems that fit the context of the workshop.
The presentation of vision or demo papers will be conducted in a designated
session during the workshop (in the form of short presentations).

All of the submissions should be in PDF format and conform to the IEEE MDM'23
proceedings format. Submitted papers must not have been published or currently
be under consideration for publication at another venue.

All of the submissions will be handled electronically. Each paper will
be  reviewed by several  members of the  program committee.
Detailed submission information will be posted on the website of the workshop.

The workshop proceedings will be published in the IEEE MDM proceedings
(volume 2) by the IEEE Computer Society and electronic versions of the papers
will be included in the IEEE Xplore and DBLP.
